lets talk about the elments and tags used for our documents out there 

remember most of the elements contain opening as well as closing tags 
<html>: The root element of an HTML document. closing tag can be </html> same for the others 
<head>: Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, scripts, and the title of the page.
<title>: Specifies the title of the web page (appears in the browser tab).

<h1>, <h2>, etc.: Header tags for headings (with <h1> being the largest).
<p>: Defines a paragraph.
<a>: Defines a hyperlink. 
<img>: Embeds an image.
<div> creates kind of a box
<ul> or <ol> unordered or ordered list declaration 
<li> list items created by this 
<b> it makes the text bolder 
<strong> this does the same thing 
&lt less than sign 
&gt greater than sign is appeared 
there are two types of tags used out in web development 
-semantic tags 
-non-semnetic tags 

 semantic tags : which are valuable as they help  developer understand the section tags and can be more organized
<header> it describes the header file 
<nav> it describes the nav bar 
<aside> it describes the side bar 
<p> it writes a paragraph or just a line 
<section> it is a section 
<fooder> it describes the nav bar 
non-semantic: you can aslo simply use one tag to use for all the elemens
<div> like the same div can be used for all the purpose
