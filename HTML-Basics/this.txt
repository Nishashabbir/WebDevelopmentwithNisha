<head>: Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, scripts, and the title of the page.
<title>: Specifies the title of the web page (appears in the browser tab).
<body>: Contains the content of the web page (visible part).
<h1>, <h2>, etc.: Header tags for headings (with <h1> being the largest).
<p>: Defines a paragraph.
<a>: Defines a hyperlink.
<img>: Embeds an image.
<div>
there are two types of tags used out in web development 
-semantic tags 
-non-semnetic tags 

 semantic tags : which are valuable as they help  developer understand the section tags and can be more organized
<header> it describes the header file 
<nav> it describes the nav bar 
<aside> it describes the side bar 
<p> it writes a paragraph or just a line 
<section> it is a section 
<fooder> it describes the nav bar 
non-semantic: you can aslo simply use one tag to use for all the elemens
<div> like the same div can be used for all the purpose
