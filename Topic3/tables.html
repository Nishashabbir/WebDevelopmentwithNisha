<!-- When you create a table you encounter these tags  -->
<!-- <tr> </tr> which means table row it creates a row  -->
<!-- <th>  </th> this specifies  the table head e.g when we give the heading of subject marks obtained and total then we use this around that row  -->
<!-- inside each row we have to create multiple columns which represent each element of the row we use the tag: th or td -->
<!-- <th></th> for the headings   or <td></td> for the simple columns  -->
<!-- lets create a simple table to understand the concept only  -->
<html>
<body>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Subject</th>
            <th>Marks Obtained</th>
            <th>Maximum Marks</th>
            <th>Grade</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        
          <tr>
            <td>Mathematics</td>
            <td>85</td>
            <td>100</td>
            <td class="grade">A</td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>

<!-- this is a table with two rows inside it and each row has 4 columns in it you can write it in vscode and see the output but it is not decorated as we still need to use the css properties in it . which we will see in the project part  -->
