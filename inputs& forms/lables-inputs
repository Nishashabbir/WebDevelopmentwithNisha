Labels in HTML are used to describe or identify input fields, making forms more user-friendly and accessible. 
The <label> tag is paired with an input using the for attribute, which matches the input's id.

remember that the for attribute of lable tag and the id attribute of input tag should have the same value ,  this is actually the point of the connection , we will discuss the name attribute
later as it is used while submitting the data 
example:
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">

when in the ouput if you see when you click on the username you automatically clicked the input field as well so it is basicallay a better way to use in the forms 
the more you will see in the project
